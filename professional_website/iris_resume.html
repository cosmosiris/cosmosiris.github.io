          <ul>
            <li>I was rated 32% Highly Effective and 68% Effective by the School administration. Effective ratings are very difficult to achieve for a first or second year teacher, let alone highly effective ratings.</li>

            <li>Incorporated Talking Circles into all my classes and in-class Meditation Sessions for one specific class that had expressed an interest. All-together this helped students overcome conflicts, practice expressing feelings, and work on understanding each other.</li>
            <li>Helped 1 student with a learning disability go from a 1st grade reading level to a 3rd grade reading level in 5 months by starting the reading-club, getting his family to purchase books that he read outside of school, and working one-on-one after school.</li>
            <li>6 of my students were at risk of being held back in the 8th grade. I worked heavily with parents and administration to get these failing students up to a passing grade. Because of this 100% of students passed my class.</li>
