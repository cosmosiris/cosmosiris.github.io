  <p>I am a former teacher and community organizer who recently moved to the Bay to pursue a career in software engineering. My work as a community organizer revealed to me that many local non-profit organizations struggle to be efficient because they lack the technical resources to maximize the investments of their employees and volunteers. In October of 2016 I began developing a number of app ideas that could revolutionize how local non-profit organizations function and began to teach myself programming through online tutorials. In June of 2017 I left my job as a teacher and I have been learning software development full-time ever since. I am looking to expand my skills at a company that can nourish my thirst for learning while contributing my creativity and innovation--a product of my wide ranging and unique experiences dating back to childhood</p>
