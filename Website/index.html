    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a former teacher and community organizer who recently moved to the Bay to pursue a career in software engineering. My work as a community organizer revealed to me that 1)many local non-profit organizations struggle to be efficient because they lack the technical resources to maximize the investments of their employees and volunteers 2)most of the popular project management and communication tools are designed for corporations and do not the meet the unique needs of social justice organizations that use mostly volunteers and few paid staff. In October of 2016 I began developing a number of app ideas that could revolutionize how local non-profit organizations function and began to teach myself programming through online tutorials. In June of 2017 I left my job as a teacher and I have been learning software development full-time ever since. I am looking to expand my skills at a company that will both nourish my thirst for learning and be open to my creativity--a product of my wide ranging and unique experiences dating back to childhood</p>
